Current Issues:

1) Task List Not Updating:In the Admin Dashboard, when an admin adds a task, it does not immediately reflect in the "Assigned Task List" below.

2) Task Synchronization Between Dashboards: Tasks added in the Admin Dashboard are not immediately visible in the Employee Dashboard.

3) Non-Functional Buttons: Buttons in the Employee Dashboard are currently not operational.

4) New User Invisibility in Chat: When a new user is created, they are not directly reflected in the "Contacts" section of an already open chat, causing unexpected behavior.
